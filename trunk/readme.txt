== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= What is missing on this plugin? =

Distinct limits for both posts and pages. We only did posts. An added bonus (that we didn't spell out but would have liked to see as it's in the similar quota module) is support for any registered post type.

Being able to set the actual number of posts per day or hour. Instead we have it set the variable as how long between posts.
